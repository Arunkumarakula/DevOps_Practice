AWS History : 
 
• AWS (Amazon Web Services) was officially launched in 2006. It started with a few core services, including Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) and Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud).
• The goal was to provide businesses with a scalable and reliable cloud computing platform. Since then, AWS has rapidly expanded its offerings, introducing hundreds of services across various domains like storage, computing, databases, machine learning, and more, making it one of the leading cloud service providers in the world. 

Regions & Availability Zones :
• AWS has 34 regions and 108 availability zones

1. Regions: A region is a geographical area that contains multiple data centers. 
• AWS has various regions around the world, such as US East, US West, Europe, Asia Pacific, and more.
• Each region is isolated from others to ensure that issues in one region do not affect the others.

2. Availability Zones (AZs): Each region consists of multiple availability zones. An availability zone is essentially a collection of one or more data centers that are physically separated from each other within the same region. 
• They are designed to be independent in terms of power, cooling, and physical security, which minimizes the risk of  failure. 
•  If one AZ experiences an issue, the other AZs can continue to operate.
