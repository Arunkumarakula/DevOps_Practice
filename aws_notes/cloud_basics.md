### ON-PREMISES
`On-premise : `on premise refers to a software,infrastructure or services located and managed with in an organisation premises rather than remotely or in the Cloud 

* Organisations Owns and controls infrastructure.
* security and access control managed internally.
* Maintenance and upgrades handled by internal IT.
* Data stored locally 

#### ADVANTAGES :

* `Control & Security :` organizations have full control over the data and security.
* `cost-effective :` No recurring cloud subscription fee.
* `Low latency :` Data is stored locally , reducing Latency.

### DISADVANTAGES :

* `High upfront costs :` Hardware and software purchases
* `space and power :` servers require physical space and power.
* `Disaster Recovery :` Organisations must handle backup and Disaster Recovery.

#### On-premise setup :

* Plan and Design server Architecture.
* purchase Hardware and software.
* Install and configure servers
* Test and Deploy applications
* Maintenan and Upgrade servers Regularly.

##### ON-PREMISES SERVER

`On-premise Servers :` on-premise Servers are computing servers located and managed with in an organization premises, rather than in a remote Data center or cloud.

#### On-premise Technologies : 

* `Servers :` Windows,Linux
* `Storage :` SAN,NAS
* `Networking :` router's, switches
* `Virtualization :` VMS, Hyper V
* `Database :` SQL server,Oracle

### Cloud computing :

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—like storage, server's, processing, and software over the internet, allowing users to access and manage data remotely instead of relying on local servers or personal computers.

* On-Demand Self service.
* Broad Network access 
* Rapid elasticity(the ability of a cloud to quickly scale to meet demand)
* pay as you go pricing 

##### Cloud computing providers :

* Amazon Web services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure 
* GCP(Google Cloud platform)
* IBM cloud 
* Oracle cloud 

##### Benefits with cloud Computing:

* Flexibility, scalability, security, collaboration, Automation, Disaster Recovery, Cost-effectiveness 

##### Cloud computing service's :

* `Compute :` Aws-ec2, Google Compute engine 
* `Storage :` Aws-S3 , Google Cloud Storage 
* `Database :` Aws-RDS, Google Cloud SQL
* `Networking :` Aws-vpc, Google Cloud Networking 
* `security :` Aws-IAM, Google Cloud IAM

### Cloud computing Models :

1. `Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):` This provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. You can rent servers, storage, and networking services. It’s like having a virtual data center. 
`Examples :` Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

2. `Platform as a Service (PaaS):` This offers hardware and software tools over the internet, mainly for application development. It allows developers to build, test, and deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. 
`Examples :` Google App Engine 

3. `Software as a Service (SaaS):` This delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access the software through a web browser without needing to install it on their local devices.
 `Examples :`Google Workspace and Microsoft 365.

### Cloud computing Deployment models :

1. `Public Cloud:` This model provides services over the public internet and is shared among multiple organizations. It’s cost-effective and scalable, with examples like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform.

2. `Private Cloud:` In this model, services are maintained on a private network for a single organization. It offers more control and security, making it suitable for businesses with strict compliance or data privacy needs.

3. `Hybrid Cloud:` This combines both public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. It provides flexibility and more deployment options, letting organizations take advantage of both environments based on their needs.

#### Cloud computing Challenges :

1. `Security and Privacy:` Storing sensitive data in the cloud raises concerns about data breaches and unauthorized access. Organizations must ensure that their cloud provider has robust security measures in place.

2. `Compliance:` Many industries have regulations regarding data storage and processing. Ensuring compliance with these regulations can be challenging when using cloud services, especially if data is stored in multiple jurisdictions.

3. `Downtime and Reliability:` Cloud services can experience outages, which can disrupt business operations. Organizations need to have contingency plans in place to handle potential downtime.

4. `Vendor Lock-In:` Switching cloud providers can be complicated and costly due to differences in platforms and services. This can make organizations hesitant to move away from a provider even if they want to.

5. `Cost Management`: While cloud services can be cost-effective, unexpected usage can lead to high bills. Organizations need to monitor and manage their cloud spending carefully.

6. `Data Transfer and Bandwidth:` Moving large amounts of data to and from the cloud can be time-consuming and may require significant bandwidth, which can be a challenge for some organizations.

### Virtualization :

* Virtualization is a technology that creates a virtual (software-based) version of a physical resource, such as server's, storage, Network, Desktop, Application 

* Virtualization allows multiple virtual resources to run on a single physical resource, improving Flexibility, scalability, security.

#### Types of Virtualization: 

* Server Virtualization : Creates multiple virtual servers on a single physical server.
* Desktop Virtualization : Creates virtual desktops for users, improving flexibility and security.
* Storage Virtualization : Combines multiple storage devices into a single virtual storage pool.
* Network Virtualization : Creates virtual networks, improving security and segmentation.

#### Virtualization Benefits:

• Increased Efficiency : Better resource utilization.
• Improved Flexibility : Easier deployment and management.
• Reduced Costs : Lower hardware and maintenance costs.
• Enhanced Security : Improved isolation and access control.
• Disaster Recovery : Easier backup and recovery.

#### HYPERVISOR 

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a piece of software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs). It allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical host.

##### Types of Hypervisors :

Type 1 Hypervisor : (Bare-Metal Hypervisor) Installs directly on the host machine's hardware.
    Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM.
Type 2 Hypervisor : (Hosted Hypervisor)Runs on top of an existing operating system.
    Examples: VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, Parallels.

##### Hypervisor Functions :

• Hardware Virtualization : Creates virtual hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage).
• Operating System Virtualization : Allows multiple OSes to run concurrently.
• Security : Provides isolation and security features
